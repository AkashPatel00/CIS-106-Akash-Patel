# CIS-106-Akash-Patel

## Assignment 1

I am taking this course because I've always had a passion and an interest in coding and programming in general. I ended up choosing Python as my language for this course because you reccomended we choose it, and also I've done research on my own and this language seemed fairly easy to learn and get a hold of. I think it'll come in handy because my educational goal for this class is to be able to understand codes and this is one of the first steps.

## Assignment 2

Over the past couple weeks, I've learned a lot about coding which I had no clue about and it's been challenging to understand it all however I've learned a lot. I understood the process of source code managment however, I didn't really put the name to the term until this week. IDE's however was a completely new concept to me however, I quickly learned that IDE's are a programmers best friend. They can edit source code, debug and even compiles. This week I tried using Repl.it and I think that it was a very user-friendly IDE which still came with all the features. Overall if I do plan to pursue a career in programming this is a tool I can always use.

## Assigment 3

This week I learned a lot more important information about coding and I was able to finally use other functions of Flowgorithm and I feel that I mastered them and understand the information a lot more. In the reading I learned new concepts which I haven't been familiar with before, and I still don't understand it all but I'm reviewing more and doing my own research in the background to get a better understanding of all the concepts. Overall I felt that this session was a big step from the others however, I think I did very good.

## Assignement 4

This week I felt was fairly easy and self explantory it built off what we learned last week, however I felt that this week we had more freedom and since we had to use our IDEs and try not to rely on Flowgorithim I felt that we had more control. I enjoyed this week and felt this helped give me an idea of what concepts I knew and what I didn't.

## Assignment 5

This week I had personal issues which ate up a lot of my time and made it so I wasn't able to finish everything on time, however with that being said the use of functions in programming was definitely a confusing experience for me and it took a lot of outside resources for me to understand how to utilize them. 

## Assignment 6 

This week I felt that this coding of functions was a lot easier in comparison to the previous week because I felt more comfortable with the functions and how to use them. I was able to code completely without the use of Flowgorithm however I still had to look back and refer to certain parts of the code.
