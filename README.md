# CIS-106-Akash-Patel

## Assignment 1

I am taking this course because I've always had a passion and an interest in coding and programming in general. I ended up choosing Python as my language for this course because you reccomended we choose it, and also I've done research on my own and this language seemed fairly easy to learn and get a hold of. I think it'll come in handy because my educational goal for this class is to be able to understand codes and this is one of the first steps.
