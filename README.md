# CIS-106-Akash-Patel

## Assignment 1

I am taking this course because I've always had a passion and an interest in coding and programming in general. I ended up choosing Python as my language for this course because you reccomended we choose it, and also I've done research on my own and this language seemed fairly easy to learn and get a hold of. I think it'll come in handy because my educational goal for this class is to be able to understand codes and this is one of the first steps.

## Assignment 2

Over the past couple weeks, I've learned a lot about coding which I had no clue about and it's been challenging to understand it all however I've learned a lot. I understood the process of source code managment however, I didn't really put the name to the term until this week. IDE's however was a completely new concept to me however, I quickly learned that IDE's are a programmers best friend. They can edit source code, debug and even compiles. This week I tried using Repl.it and I think that it was a very user-friendly IDE which still came with all the features. Overall if I do plan to pursue a career in programming this is a tool I can always use.
